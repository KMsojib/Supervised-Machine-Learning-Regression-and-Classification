# House Price Prediction Using Linear Regression

## Overview

This project aims to predict house prices using a linear regression model. The dataset includes various features such as area, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, and other characteristics that might influence the price of a house. The model achieved an accuracy of 62.05%.

## Features

The dataset includes the following features:

- **price**: The price of the house (target variable)
- **area**: The area of the house in square feet
- **bedrooms**: The number of bedrooms
- **bathrooms**: The number of bathrooms
- **stories**: The number of stories
- **mainroad**: Whether the house has access to the main road (yes/no)
- **guestroom**: Whether the house has a guest room (yes/no)
- **basement**: Whether the house has a basement (yes/no)
- **hotwaterheating**: Whether the house has hot water heating (yes/no)
- **airconditioning**: Whether the house has air conditioning (yes/no)
- **parking**: The number of parking spaces
- **prefarea**: Whether the house is located in a preferred area (yes/no)
- **furnishingstatus**: The furnishing status of the house (furnished/semi-furnished/unfurnished)

## Libraries Used

The following libraries were used in this project:

- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis
- `numpy`: For numerical computations
- `matplotlib`: For data visualization
- `seaborn`: For statistical data visualization
- `scikit-learn`: For building and evaluating the machine learning model

## Model Performance

The linear regression model achieved an accuracy of **62.05%**. This indicates that the model can explain 62.05% of the variance in house prices based on the provided features.
## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the use of linear regression to predict house prices based on various features. While the model accuracy is 62.05%, there is room for improvement. Future work could involve exploring more advanced machine learning algorithms, feature engineering, and hyperparameter tuning to improve the model's performance.
