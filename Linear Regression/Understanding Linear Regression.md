# Understanding Linear Regression

Linear regression is one of the simplest and most fundamental machine learning algorithms used to model the relationship between **input features (independent variables)** and an **output (dependent variable)** by fitting a linear equation to the data.

## 1. The Objective of Linear Regression

Linear regression tries to predict the value of a target variable  based on one or more input variables  by assuming a linear relationship between them. The model finds the best-fit line for the data by minimizing the difference between predicted values () and actual values ().

## 2. Mathematical Representation

### Simple Linear Regression (One Input Variable):

Where:

- : The predicted value of the target variable.
- : Input feature (independent variable).
- : Weight (slope of the line).
- : Bias (y-intercept of the line).

### Multiple Linear Regression (Multiple Input Features):

Where:

- : Input features.
- : Corresponding weights for each feature.

## 3. Steps to Perform Linear Regression

1. **Hypothesis**: Assume the relationship between  and  is linear.

2. **Loss Function**: Measure how well the model predicts . Commonly used:

   - **Mean Squared Error (MSE):**

     Where:
     - : Predicted value.
     - : Actual value.
     - : Number of data points.

3. **Optimization**: Adjust  and  to minimize the loss function. This is typically done using techniques like **gradient descent**.

4. **Prediction**: Once the model is trained (i.e., optimal  and  are found), use the equation  to predict new -values.

## 4. Key Components

### (a) Weight ()

- Determines the slope of the line.
- Higher  means a steeper slope, and lower  means a flatter slope.

### (b) Bias ()

- Determines where the line intercepts the y-axis.
- Helps the model fit data better when the data does not pass through the origin.

### (c) Line of Best Fit

- The line that minimizes the loss function (e.g., MSE).
- Represents the most accurate prediction for the given data.

## 5. Simple Example

Suppose we are predicting a person's height (\( y \)) based on their age (\( x \)):

| Age (\( x \)) | Height (\( y \)) |
|---------------|------------------|
| 5             | 110 cm           |
| 6             | 115 cm           |
| 7             | 120 cm           |

Using linear regression:
- Find how much height increases per year (\( w \)).
- Find \( b \) (baseline height at \( x = 0 \)).

For \( x = 8 \):
\[ \hat{y} = 5(8) + 100 = 140 \text{ cm (predicted height)} \]

## 6. Advantages of Linear Regression

- Simple and easy to interpret.
- Computationally efficient.
- Works well for linearly separable data.

---

## 7. Limitations

- Assumes a linear relationship, which may not always hold.
- Sensitive to outliers (they can significantly affect the line of best fit).
- May underperform with complex datasets that have non-linear relationships.

## 8. Real-World Applications

- Predicting house prices based on features like size, location, etc.
- Forecasting sales or stock prices.
- Estimating student performance based on study hours.

## 9. Visualization

A scatter plot with data points and the best-fit line represents the relationship between the independent and dependent variables.
